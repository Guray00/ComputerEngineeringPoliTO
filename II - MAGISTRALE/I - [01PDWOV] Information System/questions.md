# Information Systems - Written questions

The following questions are taken from the past exams of the course "Information Systems" at Politecnico di Torino. The answers are searched from the slides and generated by the IA, and are not guaranteed to be correct. The questions are divided into two categories: "Theory" and "Exercises", sometimes you can find _(G)_ to identify the ones that are not from the exams.

## Chapter 1 - Definitions

### (G) Difference between CAPEX (Capital Expenditures) e OPEX (Operating Expenditures)  

With CAPEX (Capital Expenditures), companies invest in long-term assets like machinery, buildings, or technology infrastructure. These costs are capitalized and amortized over time. Examples include purchasing machinery, constructing a building, or acquiring proprietary software.

OPEX (Operating Expenditures) are the day-to-day costs of running a business. These expenses are fully deducted in the year they are incurred. Examples include rent, utilities, salaries, and maintenance costs.

### Write one or more examples of technological innovations that deeply impacted a business domain, and therefore the strategy of companies within the domain

> Generated answer

**Digital cameras (Fuji vs Kodak)**
Digital photography fundamentally changed the photography market in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Kodak and Fujifilm, both dominant in traditional film, responded very differently:

- **Kodak** clung to its profitable film business despite inventing the first digital camera in 1975. They feared cannibalizing their core film revenue and ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 2012.
- **Fujifilm** adapted by diversifying into new industries using their chemical expertise (cosmetics, pharmaceuticals) while investing heavily in digital imaging. They survived and thrived through successful transformation.

The innovation eliminated the need for film processing, transformed photo sharing and storage, and eventually led to smartphones becoming the primary camera for most consumers. This forced a complete restructuring of the industry's value chain and business models.

## Chapter 2 - Definitions

### What are the main processes in the telecom domain?

Network management, service management, workforce management.
By using the value chain model, the main processes are operations, marketing & sales and after sale service

### What are the main processes in the process industry (oil, chemical products) domain?

Production and Maintenance of plant.

By using the value chain model, the main processes are:

- inbound logistics
- operations
- outbound logistics

### Consider  an insurance company. What are the main high level business processes the insurance must set up and operate?

> Slides: 01 - High Level Models

The main process is the service management, which includes vehicles, life, pension plan and health plans.

The value chain is:

- **inbound logistics**: managing cash flow from the customer
- **operations**: service, activation and delivery of services
- **marketing and sales**: per customer type
- **after sales service**: complaints, technical support

The main issue is the local agency and for the main site, and the data replication (life, vehicles, buildings etc...).

### Consider  a retailer (Walmart, Auchan, Carrefour or similar). What are the main high level business processes they have to set up and operate?

> Slides: 01 - High Level Models

The two main processes are:

- procurement-inbound logistics
- store management

The value chain is:

- Inbound logistics: products, supply, procurement
- Operations: stores management, supervision, control
- Marketing and sales: billing, campaign management, advertising

Issues could be:

- large number of stores, suppliers, customers
- regional warehouses
- perishable goods
- simple processes, big volumes, small margins

### Consider  a bank, what are the main high level business processes they have to set up and operate?

> Slides: 01 - High Level Models

The main high level business processes divided by level:

- **strategic level**: assess performance of a service, decision to activate a new service
- **management level**: review of negative balances, monitor employees and level of services
- **operational level**: implement operation on accounts

The main process is the service management, which includes account management, investment management, lending.

The value chain is:

- **inbound logistics**: managing cash flow from the customer
- **operations**: service, activation and delivery of services
- **marketing and sales**: per customer type
- **after sales service**: complaints, technical support

The main issues are the customer segmentation (divide business individuals SMEs and private banking), products (accounts, financial services) and data replication (often customer data replicated among units).

### Consider a Utility (seller of electricity, gas, water or similar). What are the main high level business processes they have to set up and operate?

By using the value chain model, the main processes are:

- operations
- marketing
- sales and after sale service

## Chapter 3 - ERP and CRM

### What are the three key ideas of the ERP model?

- **Data sharing** (no replication and consistency)
- **Modularity** (independent modules)
- **Prescriptivity** (same approach for all companies)

### What are the main functionalities offered by a CRM package?

CRM paradigm: multichannel interaction with customers, uniqueness of data and service and end to end service chain.

CRM main functionalities:

- commercial logistic
- multichannel interaction with customer
- after sales
- analytics of customers

### The ERP model proposes ‘data sharing’ instead of ‘legacy islands’ in information systems. Explain briefly

Legacy islands are applications working on local data that is replicated (ex list of customers replicated between application to support marketing and application to support warehouse and shippings). Data replication implies inconsistencies in data and cost of tools to support data consistency.

### In terms of CRM, give an example of a complete, end-to-end service chain

Receiving order of item from customer, planning and executing production of item, shipping item, monitoring user satisfaction, providing assistance in using item.

### Describe the high level software functions offered by an ERP

The ERP is composed of different modules, where we can recognize the T of the T model" the vertical line is related to the modules specific for the business, while the horizontal line there are the cross-industry modules.

The main modules are:

- Operations support (material planning, production planning)
- Product life cycle management
- Management support (strategic planning, budgeting)
- Supply chain management
- E-procurement
- Administration support (finance, HR management)
- Customer relationship management

### (G) Describe the three main principles of an ES

- **data sharing**: all the sw applications share the same data. In the past they were stored in different systems that needed dedicated and costly interfaces for synchronization (because of multiple companies producing sw). There are horizontal integrity (all applications share the same data) and vertical integrity (data are the same from operational level to management level)
- **modularity**: the companies that produces software sells different modules that fits different business functions.
- **Prescriptivity**:the ERP sold is, usually, the same for every customer with a limited capability of customization.

### Define the meaning of prescriptivity, its pros and cons

Prescriptivity refers to how strictly predefined rules, processes, or standards must be followed in a system. In software, it means how rigidly the system enforces specific ways of doing things.

In case of ready-to-use software modules of an external company contain a partially modifiable business logic, where each change takes time, money and a lot of effort.

### (G) Describe what is a gap analysis

With gap analysis we refer to the activity of a company to decide if it is convenient or not using (or transition to) a software to do a certain activity and if it should be bought or developed internally.

## Chapter 4 - Strategy

### Describe the four possible strategic choices for an organization, according to Porter

According to Porter, an organization has four strategic choices:

1. **Cost Leadership**: Compete by offering the lowest prices through efficient operations and economies of scale.
2. **Differentiation**: Focus on delivering unique, high-quality products or services that justify premium pricing.
3. **Cost Focus Leadership**: Target a specific niche market, offering lower-cost solutions tailored to that segment.
4. **Differentiation Focus**: Serve a niche market with highly specialized and distinctive products or services.

Each strategy emphasizes either cost or uniqueness, applied broadly or to a niche.

### Describe the multi sided business model, and provide an example of it

> Generated answer

A multi-sided business model creates value by enabling direct interactions between two or more distinct groups of customers or participants. The key insight is that this model acts as an intermediary that connects different groups who can benefit from each other, creating what economists call "network effects" - where the platform becomes more valuable to everyone as more people use it.

**First example**
Uber connects two distinct groups:

1. First Side: Riders who need transportation
2. Second Side: Drivers who want to earn money providing rides

In this way, these sides complement each other:

- More riders on the platform attract more drivers (because they'll have more customers)
- More drivers attract more riders (because wait times decrease)

Each new participant makes the platform more valuable for everyone else. The platform creator (Uber in this case) typically makes money by taking a percentage of each transaction, while providing the technology infrastructure, trust mechanisms, and rules that make interactions possible.

**Second example**
Another example is credit card networks like Visa: They connect merchants who want to accept payments with consumers who want convenient ways to pay And banks who provide the financial services. Each group benefits from the others' participation, creating a robust ecosystem.

**Third example**
> from slides
Google brings together customers, content providers and advertisers.

**Forth example**
> from exam
Commeercial TV (free content for end users, paid ad time for companies)



### Considering the Business Model Canvas approach, describe briefly the long tail business model, and provide an example of it

> Slides: 03 - Strategy

The long tail is a business model that focuses on selling a large number of unique items in relatively small quantities, rather than selling a small number of popular items in large quantities. This model is made possible by the internet and digital technologies (content industry), which allow companies to reach niche markets and offer a wide variety of products to customers.

- **traditional**: sell large quantities of few items
- **long tail**: sell small quantities of many items

the long tail approach can be more profitable than traditional.

The conditions that mad this approach possible are:

- Democratization of production tools
- Democratization of distribution
- Better link supply and demand

An example of the long tail business model is Amazon, which offers a vast selection of products from mainstream to niche categories, allowing customers to find unique items that may not be available in traditional retail stores.

### List the possible Customer relationship modes according to the Business Model Canvas

> Slides: 03 - Strategy

- **Personal assistance**: Face to face or via email/call center
- **Dedicated personal assistance**: for example upscale financial services
- **Self service**
- **Automated services**: as self service bust customized on customer
- **User community**: to share knowledge and support customers
- **Co-creation**: for example ex youtube, amazon book reviews given by customers

### Define fixed vs. variable costs, make an example

Fixed costs do not depend on the number of items sold/products (e.g., infrastructure cost), and variable costs, which depend on the number of units sold (e.g., electricity costs)

### According to the Business Model Canvas model, list the possible Customer segments

- Entire population (mass market)
- only a certain subset of the population (niche market)
- segmented to focus on different segments (different markets)
- diversified to focus, multisided

### According to the Business Model Canvas model, mention a few types of value propositions

The value proposition is a list of all products and services, how they produce benefits and provide gains for the customer, how they alleviate problems and reduce negative emotion and undesired things.

Some of them are:

- Newness
- Performance
- customization
- "Getting the job done"
- Price
- Status
- Design
- Cost reduction
- Risk reduction
- Accessibility
- Usability

## Chapter 5 - Management IS

### A company produces vehicles. What could be its CSF (Critical Success Factors) at corporate level?

Quality, cost, reliability, dealer’s network, brand recognition.

### Consider a car glass manufacturer. Define, using the Balanced Score Card (BSC) approach one meaningful indicator in each dimension of BSC

Indicators for each dimension:

- **Financial** → cash flow
- **Customer** → customer satisfaction
- **Internal process** → performance quality
- **Innovation and learning** → employee turnover

### Consider a company that produces processed food (ex. canned meat, snacks). Define, using the Balanced Score Card (BSC) approach one meaningful indicator in each dimension of BSC.

Indicators for each dimension:

- **Financial** → cash flow
- **Customer** → quality
- **Internal process** → performance quality
- **Innovation and learning** → employee turnover

## Chapter 6 - Organization

### In organizational terms, what is a ‘Machine bureaucracy’?

> Slides: 05 - Organization

It is a mid-sized manufacturing firm.

> Generated answer

Machine bureaucracy is a type of organizational structure characterized by a high degree of formalization and specialization.

It is based on the principles of standardization, predictability, and efficiency. In a machine bureaucracy, tasks are broken down into specific roles and responsibilities, and employees are expected to follow established procedures and rules. Decision-making is centralized, and communication flows through hierarchical channels. This type of structure is common in large, stable organizations where efficiency and consistency are valued over flexibility and innovation.


### Give a definition of SOP and an example

> Slides: 05 - Organization

**Standard Operating Procedures**, precise rules procedures and practices to cope with virtually all expected situations.

An example could be a bank transfer or a call center with customer support L1, where you have to consider every possible situation and how to handle it.

SOPs are typically the starting point for automation using IS.

### Provide an example of a company that is organized in both functional and geographic units.

Geographic: the same function is replicated geographically (ex. Apple, sale function in Europe, in US, ...)

A function located in many places (ex. factory for engine in Melfi, for body in Turin) does not mean
geographical organization.

### What characterizes a divisional organization?

Each division focused on a product, replicates some functions.

### A company produces glasses for cars, it has an office in Turin, with the direction, sales office, accounting office, human resources. A factory in Nice (France) and another in Naples. There is no design office (designs are received from the car manufacturer). What kind of organization does it follow?

Functional (no functions are repeated.) It is partially geographical because manufacturing is repeated in two places (assuming that the same products are produced in the two factories).

### An insurance company is organized as follows: a holding company owns three other companies: OnlineI proposes and sells only online car policies; TraditionalI proposes and sells life and car policies through a network of sales offices throughout Italy; DamageE performs damage evaluations, for OnlineI, for TraditionalI and for any other insurance. What kind of organization is using this company?

Divisional (one for online sales, one for traditional channel sales, one for damage evaluations). DamageE could also be seen as a function common to the divisions.


### In terms of organization theory, compare an organization of type ‘bureaucracy’ with one of type ‘startup’  

- Bureaucracy: large size, high depth in org chart, medium / high formalization and specialization, closer to mechanical system (more efficient than flexible)
- Startup: small size, (nearly no) depth in org chart, very low formalization and specialization, closer to natural adaptive system (more flexible than efficient)

### A company has two full time employees, and one part time (50%) employee. How many FTE does the company have?

(1+1+.05) = 2.5

### A small manufacturing company has a factory, a warehouse, an administration office, a sales office in Turin covering Italy, a sales office in Madrid covering Spain and Portugal. What kind of organizational structure is this?

Geo (sales), functional (manufacturing, admin)

### In a large company the IT function can be centralized or decentralized. What are the advantages and disadvantages of centralized IT?

Advantages of centralized IT: standardization of data and procedures, no redundancy of data, economy of scale in operation of IT and purchase of hardware and software.

Disadvantages: less reactivity to requests from other business functions / units, less specialization

### In the COBIT model, what are the main processes in domain Deliver and Support?

> Slides: 06 - 2 Cobit 5

- Manage operations
- Manage service requests and incidents
- Manage problems
- Manage continuity
- Manage security services
- Manage business process controls


### Describe the  main activities in the Build and acquire process of COBIT

> Slides 06 - 2 Cobit 5

The COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) is a reference document that aims at aligning Business and IT Strategy meant for managers and auditors.

Implements, in some way, the management control loop:

- Definition of objectives becomes plan
- Corrective actions become build
- Execution becomes run
- Control results becomes monitor

The main activities in the 'Build and acquire' process of COBIT are:

- Manage programmes and projects
- Manage requirements definition
- Manage solutions identification and build
- Manage availability and capacity
- Manage change acceptance and transitioning
- Manage organizational change management
- Manage changes
- Manage knowledge
- Manage assets
- Manage configuration

Programme == many related projects
For one project:

- Define requirements
- Identify solutions, build
Horizontal / support activities
- Change test and deploy
- Org change
- Changes, knowledge, assets, configuration

## Chapter 7 - Economics

### Describe the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for a software package (such as Excel)

Search and evaluate, acquire, install (first time), learn, install (patches and fixes), uninstall

### Describe the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for a software service (ex an ERP used as a service)

Search for vendor, contract negotiation, service quality monitoring, service fee.

### Describe the concept of IT alignment, and provide an example.

With IT alignment we refer to the fact that IT area must support organization strategy and IT governance deals with that. In that sense IT alignment is the key point.

In IT alignment the aspects to be considered are:

- **Business strategy**: Scope, Distinctive competencies, Business governance
- **Organization infrastructure and process**: Org structure, Processes, Skills
- **IT strategy**: Technology scope, Systemic competencies, IT Governance
- **IT infrastructure and process**: Architecture, Processes, Skills

**Example 1: Retail bank1**
- Strategy: attract customers with better services
- IS function: more budget to improve services at counter, web site, call center: delays, flexibility

**Example 2: Retail bank2**
- Strategy: attract customers with higher interest rates, no frill services
- IS function: less budget to save money, less investment in front end

### What are the key factors to consider in the decision about outsourcing an IT activity?

- The activity is a **commodity** vs is **specific**
- The activity is related to a competitive advantage for the organization or not
- The activity manages sensitive data or not
- The activity can be described precisely and controlled (ie it is possible to define effective SLAs)
- lock-in is avoidable (there are more vendors for the activity and switching is feasible)
- Cost and quality - cost should include visible (search, negotiation, contract) and especially hidden costs
- The organization can loose the know how regarding the activity (and possibly regain it in case of insourcing back later).

### The strategic goal of a service company is 'customer satisfaction'. Because of budget restrictions on IT, whenever a customer accesses the web site of the company to obtain a service, he or she has to wait too much. This is a symptom of what?

No IT Alignment. The customer must wait (because of poor IT) and 'customer satisfaction' goal is missed, because of the budget restrictions on IT.

### What are the main concepts of Agency theory?

> Solutions

The idea of Agency Theory revolves around what happens when one party (the principal) delegates authority to another party (the agent) to act on their behalf. This creates challenges because the principal and agent often have different interests and access to different information.

The contrast between goals of agents and principal causes agency costs (to be reduced as much as possible). The costs are:

- Monitoring: Control of agent by principal
- Bonding: Reporting, by agent to principal, on activities done
- Residual loss: Lost profits by principal, due to suboptimal behavior of agent

> An example could be like hiring someone to sell your house. As the homeowner (principal), you want the highest possible price, but the real estate agent (agent) might prefer a quick sale for a lower commission.

### What has been the effect of the wider adoption of IT on agency costs?

Reduction in agency and bonding costs, possibly limited reduction in residual losses

> Generated answer

Information technology has impacted agency costs in three main ways:

- For monitoring costs, IT has reduced the expense and difficulty of tracking agent behavior.
- For bonding costs, technology has made it easier for agents to demonstrate their commitment to principals' interests.
- For residual loss (costs from remaining misalignment of interests), advanced analytics and AI can now identify potential agency problems early by detecting unusual patterns in data.

### What could be the hidden costs in an IT application outsourcing relationship?

- If current provider discontinues the product / service, or if quality too low.
- search for other product / provider (or cost of insourcing)
- convert data
- litigation

### (G) According to the decision theory, how many types of decisions exists?

There are three types of decisions:

- Structured: follows an algorithm and is repeatable
- semi-structured: output is defined , inputs and decisions ar partially defined
- Unstructured: no algorithm, subjective

### (G) Describe one of the logical fallacies that can affect decision making

The logical fallacies are flaws in reasoning or tricks to obfuscate the truth to push a certain decision:

- **Ad hominem**: attack the person to attack the argument
- **Anecdotal**: use a personal experience as an argument
- **Appeal to emotion**: use emotions as an argument (used in most commercials)
- **Appeal to authority**: a person with authority is more trusted than scientific method
- **Ambiguity**: use an unclear description to support an argument
- **Burden of proof**: make a claim and let others prove it is false
- **Circular reasoning**: use argument to prove argument


## Chapter 8 - High level models

### According to the Anthony's model, what characterizes the operational level? Make some examples

> Slides: 01 - High Level Models

The Anthony's model (pyramidal model) mixes the hierarchical levels into the organization and the business functions, putting them into a pyramid where at each intersection different IS functions are needed.

There are multiple organizational levels:

- **Operational level**: composed by the employees that work day by day and with repetitive activities.
- **Knowledge level**: composed by knowledge and data workers that design new products/services on the present/future time frame. This level is present only in organizations that need designing.
- **Management level**: composed by middle managers that control and plan activities of the operational level, which works on the near future time frame.
- **Strategic level**: composed by seniors and high managers that takes key decisions on future.

The operational level is characterized by the information **intensity of product** (level of information ended to describe the product) and the **information intensity of the process** (level of information needed to describe the process).

Some examples of operational level are:

- For a city: citizen payment accounting, road maintenance, pollution measurement
- For a bank: account operations (withdrawals, bank transfers ...)
- For water bottling company: recording of orders


### Describe shortly the T Model of organizations

> Slides: 01 - High Level Models

The T model is a model that has an horizontal part common for every kind of organization and a vertical part specific for the business sector/domain.

The tree precesses are:

- Support processes: IT, HR, accounting, finance and firm infrastructure, is not bisible for the final customer
- Managerial processes: strategic planning , BI and management control
- Primary processes: produce and provision the products/services


---

## Uncategorized

### Define 'network effect' (or demand side economy of scale) and give an example of it

Value of service depends on number of users, and grows way more than linearly with number of users.

For example: telephone network, social network.

### List a few principles to be applied in process redesign

### When doing process redesign, four dimensions should be considered and flexibility. Define the meaning of 'flexibility' in this context

- Capability of process to react (possibly with no changes on time cost quality)
- to changes in workload (input / output volume)
- resources (ex employees, machines) needed
- customer needs

### Given an organization with functional structure, the IT area could be centralized or decentralized. Explain pros and cons of a centralized IT area

The IT area is the organizational entity that supports IT services to an organization. Only companies above a certain turnover/size threshold can sustain an IT area. The it area can be:

- **Centralized IT area**
  - Pros:
    - Economy of scale (noo duplication of assets)
    - Standardization
    - Data sharing
    - Governance: control of IT budget and costs, enforcement of IT strategy
    - Consistency of data
  - Cons:
    - Less reactivity to requests
    - Less specialization

In the past the IT worked only under the finance department, and only after some time it started working also for every other departments causing a divergence because each application was different and not correlated.

### In ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) the service operation process must handle incidents, problems and events. Which is the difference between incident, problem, event?

> Generated answer

**Event**
An event is an occurrence that has significance for IT infrastructure management or service delivery. It could be considered as a notifications from your IT systems - like a server reaching 80% capacity, a scheduled backup completing successfully, or a user logging into an application.

**Incident**
An incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in the quality of an IT service. Incidents directly impact users and require rapid resolution to restore normal service operation.

**Problem**
A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. Problem management focuses on finding and addressing root causes to prevent incidents from recurring.



### Mention one cognitive bias and explain how it can affect decisions

- **Confirmation bias** leads us to favor information that supports our existing beliefs while dismissing contradictory evidence. For instance, someone who believes in a particular diet's effectiveness might only read success stories about it while ignoring scientific studies showing its limitations.

- **Motivated reasoning** occurs when we let our desired outcome influence how we process information. A sports fan might blame a loss on poor refereeing when their team loses but praise the team's skill when they win. Another example could be related to smoking.

- **Survivorship bias** happens when we focus only on successful examples while overlooking failures. This creates a distorted view of reality. An example could be the aircraft coming back from the war that were reinforced in the hit parts.

- **Optimistic bias** causes us to believe we're less likely to experience negative events than others. A smoker might acknowledge smoking's dangers while believing they personally won't get sick.

- **Bandwagon effect** describes our tendency to adopt beliefs or behaviors simply because many others have done so. This explains why fashion trends spread or why people might invest in cryptocurrency just because others are doing it.

- **Cognitive dissonance** describes the mental discomfort we feel when holding contradictory beliefs or when our actions don't align with our values. To reduce this discomfort, we often change our beliefs rather than our behavior. For example, someone who believes in environmental protection but drives an SUV might downplay climate change concerns to feel better about their choice.

- **Dunning-Kruger effect** occurs when people with limited knowledge or expertise overestimate their abilities because they don't know enough to recognize their own incompetence. A novice programmer might feel confident about their skills after learning basic syntax, not realizing how much more there is to software development.

- **Repetition bias** leads us to believe something is true simply because we've heard it multiple times. This explains why marketing slogans and political messages become more convincing through repeated exposure, regardless of their accuracy.

- **Authority bias** makes us more likely to believe and follow people in positions of authority, even in areas outside their expertise. We might trust a famous doctor's financial advice simply because they're successful in medicine.

- **Anchoring bias** occurs when we rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making decisions. In salary negotiations, the first number mentioned often serves as an "anchor" that influences the final agreement, regardless of market value.

- **Loss aversion** describes how we feel the pain of losses more intensely than the pleasure of equivalent gains. This is why many people hold onto losing investments too long - the pain of accepting the loss outweighs the potential benefit of investing elsewhere.

### Describe the 'Dunning Kruger' effect

The **Dunning-Kruger effect** occurs when people with limited knowledge or expertise overestimate their abilities because they don't know enough to recognize their own incompetence. A novice programmer might feel confident about their skills after learning basic syntax, not realizing how much more there is to software development.

### Define 'culture' as organizational variable, and make an example of two opposite company cultures

> Slides 05 - Organization

Culture is the tacit social order of an organization. It norms and define what is encouraged, discouraged, accepted or rejected within a group. A cultural change will involve a transformation of an organization through multiple phases.

They are written or unwritten assumption about goals, products and employees.

A good example of Working Culture is Patagonia:

- Embrace work flexibility
- Read CVs from the bottom up (interests, activities specifically outdoor)
- On site child care

A culture can be either an unifying factor and a restraint on change, specifically when it comes to IT.

As an example, we can compare a Traditional Corporate Culture with a Startup Culture:

- Corporate Culture
  - Hierarchical structure
  - Formal communication
  - Risk-averse
  - Strict procedures
  - Emphasis on stability
  - Slow decision-making
- Innovative Startup Culture
  - Flat organizational structure
  - Open communication
  - Risk-tolerant
  - Flexible work practices
  - Emphasis on creativity
  - Rapid decision-making

### According to the 5 forces Porter model, the strategy of an organization should consider 5 forces. One of them is 'substitute products'. Define what it means and make an example

Different product that can substitute another and kill it. The substitute product is typically made by a company coming from another business domain.

Ex.: Music streaming service (Spotify - software company) vs music on hard device (Sony music,Virgin, content producer companies)
Ex.: paper towels (Kleenex, chemical company) vs textile towels (textile company)

### What should be considered when selecting one option out of many in an outsourcing decision?

- Cost, quality and service
- Strategic efforts
- Know how and protection of data

When we outsource something, we need to define some SLAs (Service Level Agreements) to ensure that the service provider will deliver the service as expected. The SLAs should be defined based on the business needs and the criticality of the service. The SLAs should be monitored and reviewed periodically to ensure that the service provider is meeting the agreed levels of service.

### Which are the three most common IS architecture models, and how they differ?

> Generated answer

**Silos Architecture:**

- Each application has its own dedicated database and business logic
- No data sharing between applications
- Simple to implement but leads to data duplication and inconsistency
- Difficult to get a unified view of business data

**Shared Database Architecture:**

- Single **centralized** database used by all applications
- Ensures **data consistency** and reduces redundancy
- Enables easier **data analysis** and reporting
- Can become a **performance bottleneck**
- Changes to database schema **affect all** applications

**Microservices Architecture:**

- Applications split into independent, specialized services
- Each service manages its own data and can use different technologies
- Services communicate through APIs
- Highly scalable and maintainable
- More complex to implement and manage
- Enables independent deployment and scaling of components
- Better fault isolation

### What is the BOM, Bill Of Materials?

> Slides: 01 - High Level Models

For each product, the list of components and materials (parts) needed to produce it. It answer to the following questions:

- what supplies are needed for product Y?
- What is the cost of supplies for product Y?
- Which categories of supplies are needed for product Y?
- What parts are common between product Y and product Z?

### Describe the Conway's Law and its application to Information systems

> Generated answer

Conway's Law states that organizations design systems that mirror their communication structures. In other words, the way people communicate and collaborate within an organization will shape the structure and design of the systems they create. This principle was first articulated by computer programmer Melvin Conway in 1967.

It also states that even adopting a centralized approach, if there is no control, it will flow to a decentralized approach because of entropy.

### Describe the differences between time and material and fixed price market transactions

Time & material and fixed price are two types of market transactions that differ in how they structure the relationship between the buyer and the seller.

- **Time & Material**: price defined after delivery, in function of material and time spent. The price is typically calculated as an hourly rate for labor plus the cost of materials. This model offers flexibility because the buyer can adjust the project scope and requirements as needed. However, it can be risky for the buyer if the project takes longer than expected or if the seller inflates the hours worked.
- **Fixed Price**: price defined upfront with a description of requirements. The seller bears the risk of cost overruns or delays, while the buyer benefits from cost predictability. However, this model can be less flexible if the project scope changes or if unexpected issues arise.

Pros and cons of each:

- **Time and material**: Con: seller does not know price, seller can try to inflate time and material; Pro, adaptable to changes in requirements.
- **Fixed price**: Pro, buyer knows price. Con: seller can try to reduce quality, no flexibility to change requirements, ambiguity on requirements.


### Describe the PICK chart as used to select processes to improve

The PICK chart is a graphic representation that divides the possible process improvements in four different categories:

- **Possible**: easy improvements with small payoff
- **Implement**: Easy improvements with high payoff
- **Challenge**: big and difficult improvements with high payoff
- **Kill**: difficult improvements with low payoff (better to discard)


### Describe the high level software functions offered by a CRM

### What is the meaning of 'economy of scope'? Provide an example

Economy of scope is the ability of a company to share resources and capabilities across different products or services. This allows the company to reduce costs and increase efficiency by leveraging existing assets and expertise in multiple areas.

The idea is to share fixed costs on a larger variety of products (vs economy of scale, share fixed cost by increasing the production of same product) using the same infrastructure to produce different units'products.

An example could be Parmalat, which started as a milk producer and then expanded into other products like yogurts or biscuits.

Another example is a general bank, which develops the infrastructure for bank services and then can reuse the same one for insurances.

### What is the management cycle? How indicators such as KPIs fit into it?

Define goals (and related measures such as KPIs), collect measures from the operations level, compare.
actual measures and goals, do corrective actions if needed

### In a large company the IT function can be centralized or decentralized. What are the advantages of centralized IT?

Standardization of data and procedures, no redundancy of data, economy of scale in operation of IT and purchase of hardware and software

### (G) Describe three levels of organizational change

- **First order change**: _automate_ existing processes, it occurs with the introduction of an IT innovation that modifies how an existing process is performed.
- **Second order change**: _informate_, it modifies the way individuals perform processes and the manner in which they interact with the technology change. It can require training and overcome the human tendency to resist change.
- **Third order change**: _trasformate_, it affects the structure:
  - Technology: a change in the way the organization selects, uses and manages technology.
  - People: a change in the reporting and authority structure of the organization.
  - Process: a novel way of task accomplishment or a new set of task.

### A company produces vehicles. What could be its CSF (Critical Success Factors) at Corporate level?

Quality, cost, reliability, dealer’s network, brand recognition.

### In the context of the BMC, describe the ‘product innovation’ business model

> generated answer

The product innovation business model prioritizes creating value through **continuous development** of innovative products and services. It requires significant R&D investment, strong intellectual property management, and rapid development cycles. Companies using this model typically command premium prices by offering unique features or superior performance.

### In the context of change management, describe the Gleicher formula

> notes

The David Gleicher formula (D * V * F > R) says that: Dissatisfaction for current situation, Vision (capability to define the future situation) and First steps (quantity and quality of actions to support the transition) must overcome Resistance to change.

The resistance to change is also function of the type of of change:

- first order: automate
- second order: informate
- third order: trasformate

### What is the pros and cons of defining  business rules independently of applications?

- Pro: business rules are defined in high level, readable form (clarity)
- Pro: business rules are defined once for all applications (consistency)
- Pro: business rules can be evolved once for all applications (less cost of maintenance)
- Con: more complexity in set up and maintenance of BRMS

### What elements are considered by Function Point Analysis to estimate the size of a project?

See slides

Divisional (ports, airports..) Geographical (repeated offices)

## A small manufacturing company selects these options for their IS. Every employee has a laptop connected to a wifi network. No server is installed on premise, data space is purchased on the cloud, and an ERP / CRM product is used as a service. Frame this case in terms of the outsourcing dimensions

There are different levels to be considered:

- laptop, wifi: infrastructure, not clear from text if rental or acquisition, on site
- data space: infrastructure, not unique, offsite
- erp/crm: application, (probably) not unique, offsite

### considering the business model canvas approach, describe briefly the free business model, and provide an example of it

note: this question is generated.

The free business model is based on the idea of offering a product or service for free to attract a large user base, and then monetizing through other means such as advertising, premium features, or complementary products. This model is often used in digital industries where marginal costs are low and network effects are strong.

### considering the business model canvas approach, describe briefly the freemium business model, and provide an example of it

note: this question is generated.

The basic service is offered for free and the premium one requres a fee (it works if the cost of serving the free service is low).

Examples:

- Skype: free calls between Skype users, paid calls to landlines and mobiles.
- Flickr: free storage for a limited number of photos, paid for unlimited storage.

### considering the business model canvas approach, describe briefly the bait and hook business model, and provide an example of it

note: this question is generated.

Upfront there is a free or very cheap offer, but later there are fees to pay.

### ‘Decision cost’:  explain the concept and how IT influences it

> Slides: 03 - Economics

If decisions are taken where information is not produced. 

- communcation, documentation in form of cost of collection and transmission of data to higher levels.
- Opportunity cost: delays in availability of information at higher levels and lost opportunities
- Suboptimal decisions: because of delays, imprecision or cognitive biases.

### A BPMN model can be enacted. Explain what this means and how it works

A BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) model being "enacted" means it can be directly executed by process engines, transforming the visual diagram into actual running software. In this case, the model (ex BPMN + java addons) is automatically translated into an executable process. It requires a process engine that receives the process and executes it (same approach used for interpreted languages). This can be compared to the traditional approach which involves writing manually one or more programs (ex in Java or C# or else) that support a process. In this case the process model is not available, or if available the transition to programs is manual.

### In the context of digital marketing, describe the digital marketing funnel

See slides

> Generated answer

ITIL v3 Service Operation consists of five key processes:

1. Event Management
2. Incident Management
3. Problem Management
4. Request Fulfillment
5. Access Management

Each process has defined inputs, activities, outputs and interfaces with other ITIL processes.

### (G) Describe the 5 forces model by Porter

Porter defined the 5 forces model that identifies and analyzes five competitive forces that shape every industry and helps determine an industry's weaknesses and strengths. These forces are:

- **substitute products**: new products that substitute and kill the ones you are selling
- **bargaining power of customers**: have few customers with large volumes can lead to a form of dependence to them
- **bargaining power of suppliers**: higher cost for the supplier's products cause your price to increase, if they increase too much you can be out of the market
- **New entrants**: the ease with which a competitor can enter the company's market
- **Intensity of rivalry**: how many competitors are in the market

An example could be kodak vs Fuji: while Fuji changing is business sector from the picture domain to the chemical products that allowed to increase its lifespan, Kodak decided to remain in the cameras sector taking a wrong strategic decision.

## Exercises

### Sketch here the BM canvas for CARS

- Key partners: car manufacturers, airlines,
- Key activities: customer relationship, car maintenance, car selection and allocation
- Key resources: cars, parking lots, reservation system (IT)
- Value proposition: car rental with best service and low prices
- Cost structure: cars (purchase and maintenance), personnel, IT
- Customer relationship: self-service,
- Channels: web, call centre, (office)
- Customer segmentation: businessmen, tourists, ...
- Revenue stream: rental fees, car resell

### Considering company strategies and the Porter model about company strategies, discuss in which quadrant of the model CARS could position itself, and why (car sharing digitalized company)

> From an exam

Mass market with cost leadership

#### 13  The CARS company operates in Italy. The headquarters are in Rome. They deal with reservations, commercial policies, accounting, HR, IT, and they monitor the fleet of cars (purchases, resales). Throughout Italy are offices. Each office manages interaction with customers, and maintenance of car (cleaning, simple maintenance). What kind of organizational structure is this?

Functional + geografic

### Lessons at Polito are supported by BigBlueButton, an open source product, that is installed on a number of computers property of Polito and installed in Polito premises. Frame this case in terms of the outsourcing dimensions

> Slides: 06 - Outsourcing
> Answer not confirmed

- Location: on site
- Unicity: shared
- Activity: Application

### Company Music is an e-commerce company that sells vinyl records. Shipping of parcels is outsourced to another company. Propose a few SLAs to allow Music monitor the outsourcing relation

> Slides: 06 - Outsourcing

To define SLAs to monitor the transaction is possible to take inspiration from some KPIs, such as:

- Cost:
- Reliability/availability
- Response time
- Flexibility

### Sketch below an organizational chart for a company organized in divisions

See slides

### The WATER company uses a module of an ERP package to manage technical activities (planning and monitoring of water connection jobs). Discuss if this decision makes sense or not

Using an ERP is an outsourcing decision (support for technical activities is made through a package acquired outside, and not built internally) The decision makes sense. The activity is not strategic, not unique, is a commodity, data is not sensitive.

### The WATER company covers the Piedmont region. It has one technical office and one commercial office in each province of Piedmont. Headquarters, HR, accounting and IT are in Turin. What kind of organizational structure is this?

It is functional (headquarters, HR, accounting IT) + geographic (technical + commercial offices)

### The taxi company TXI owns and operates taxis. Besides, the company manages a call center that receives taxi requests, and dispatches them to taxi drivers. Recently TXI has introduced an app for smartphones. Customers can call the taxi using the app instead of the call center.  The app is developed and operated by company TAXIAPP.

#### 1. Characterize the outsourcing relation between TXI and TAXIAPP over the three outsourcing dimensions

- **Unicity**: probably a standard product, w some adaptation
- **Location**: on premise of TAXIAPP (off site)
- **Service**: it infrastructure + application

#### 2. Define a few (max 3) SLAs to monitor the outsourcing relation from the point of view of TXI


- Cost of service (per year, or per unit)
- Quality of service (ex customer satisfaction)
- Reliability of service

### Consider the travel management process of point 1 (travel payments for employee).  Identify in it the categories of agency costs (according to agency theory)

- **Monitoring**: admin employee effort + director effort to control travel request (avoid cheating of employees) , admin employee effort to control travel reimbursement request (avoid cheating, false evidence etc).  
- **Bonding**: traveling employee effort to justify travel, to justify expenses 
- **Residual loss**: cost of travel higher than needed

### A company develops internally its web site (that supports all information on its products plus ecommerce) and deploys it on a virtual machine rented by an external provider. Besides, it uses a complete call center operated by another company to provide assistance to customers for the ecommerce site. Characterize this case in terms of the 3 outsourcing dimensions.

- Web application:  
  - Activity= application
  - location=onsite
  - unicity= dedicated
- Hardware:
  - Activity= IT infrastructure
  - location=offsite
  - unicity= shared
- Call center:
  - Activity= process
  - location=offsite 
  - unicity= dedicated (the specific CRM service) + shared (the call center infrastructure and personnel)

#### Propose a few SLAs to monitor the relationship with the call center company

- % of satisfied customers
- Unit average cost for an interaction with a customer
- Average, min, max Time the customer must wait at telephone line before operator answers

### In the GYM case the management of the IS is completely subcontracted to an external IT company. GYM has only one employee that plays the role of CIO, overlooks to all IT needs of the company, monitors the operation of IT and interacts with the subcontract. Propose a few SLAs to monitor the outsourcing relation between GYM and the external IT provider.

- Cost of service per year Availability of service
- Protection of customer data

#### Considering the 3 outsourcing dimensions, place this outsourcing case over the 3 dimensions

- **Site**: off site (servers and software personnel outside GYM) + in site (Pcs for personnel, card readers + turnstiles)
- **Unicity**: not unique (commercial package to handle gym companies, with some customized parts)
- **Activity**: infrastructure (servers) + application (to handle GYM)  (remark it is not outsourcing of processes, processes are all handled by GYM employees)

### Propose an organization chart for GYM (a gym company). Write clearly what organizational model you use

Functional  finance, HR, accounting, marketing are centralized in headquarters.

Geographical ‘manufacturing’ (in sense of operating the centers) and sales (in sense of managing  payments from customers) are replicated in each center  remark it is not divisional.

The product / service offered is the same by all centers, so it is geo+functional

### In the previous case the hospital decides to outsource the IT infrastructure (all kind of computer equipment and network) to an external company, while keeps internally the development and operation of software

#### Propose a few SLAs to monitor the outsourcing relation between the hospital and the external IT provider

- cost per computer per year (with computer defined as: cpu clock > xGhz, ram > y GB etc)
- cost per network service per year ( service defined as: bandwidth > zB/sec, latency <  x sec)
- availability of servers > 99.99%
- availability of client PCs > 99%

#### Considering the 3 outsourcing dimensions, place this outsourcing case over the 3 dimensions

- **Activity**: infrastructure Location: on site
- **Unicity**: shared (commodity PCs and network)

### Analyze the hospital drug management case in terms of Agency theory and Decision theory

- Agency: monitoring cost (supervisor on responsible of warehouses, responsible of warehouses on employees)
- Bonding
- Residual loss: orders too large / too small / too late  
- Decision:
  - Documentation: IS for logging all transactions
  - Opportunity: computing best time to place order, optimal quantity

### In the METROT case RFID cards to support ticketing are of two types: anonymous (for short life tickets) and personal (with picture and name of owner – for long term tickets). The production  and customization of these cards is made by company CARDS-T. What SLA (service level agreements) would you use to monitor and control CARDS-T ?

Unit price of card Lead time (from order to delivery) Conformity (number of defective cards / total) Protection of privacy of data (names, pictures of customers)

#### Propose an organization chart for METROT (around 50 administrative people, 2000 drivers, 50 mechanics for maintenance). Write clearly what organizational model you use.

Given the medium size and the product (one product with little innovation levels) the organization could be functional: sales (ticketing, tariffs, sales); production (management and maintenance of vehicles, lines, drivers); human resources, administration. A design office could be in charge of designing and adapting the product (bus / tram lines and services). An IT office could be in charge of IT support and technologies in general.   Another option is to have a divisional organization (metro, buses, trams). However this leads to the risk of offering not integrated services. But different systems (especially the metro) have different problems and require different skills. A reasonable option is to have a functional organization, with production unit split in three (bus, tram, metro).

### What SLA (service level agreements) would you use to monitor and control the company managing the outsourced cadaster?

C_D_state (only for part relative to cadaster management, D_pay to D_close in activity diagram) LT_record


### An insurance company is organized as follows: a holding company owns three other companies: OnlineI proposes and sells only online car policies;  TraditionalI proposes and sells life and car policies through a network of sales offices throughout Italy; DamageE performs damage evaluations, for OnlineI, for TraditionalI and for any other insurance. What kind of organization is using this company?

Divisional (one for online sales, one for traditional channel sales, one for damage evaluations). 
DamageE could also be seen as a function common to the divisions.

### considering the thesis management case (from the previous part of the exam), and considering the business model canvas approach, characterize cr (customer relationship) and the channel between the student and the university

- cr: self service (no customized service, no dedicated personnel)
- channel: web portal

### What kind of change is the one described in the Vehicle Ticket case? (first, second, third order? – motivate your answer) 

> Communications from the authority to the citizen are notified via PEC (instead of paper). The citizen [...] accesses a web site of the authority and here performs all needed operations.

Second order, since the process does not change, only communications are digitalized. However people are impacted, both officers (who need some training on the new software functions) and citizens.
